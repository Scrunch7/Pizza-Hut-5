				<p>The first New Zealand Pizza Hut restaurant opened in New Lynn (Auckland) in September 1974. We currently have over 100 Pizza Hut stores throughout New Zealand. Nearly everyone
				 anywhere can enjoy a tasty Pizza Hut pizza!
				We’re constantly on the lookout for ways to improve our customer service -that means fine tuning this website, and keeping our incredibly motivated team members up to date with
				 the latest customer service trends.</p>

				<h3>MAKING THE EXPERIENCE EVEN BETTER</h3>
				
				<p>We never stand still and we always want to know how we can get better. And we want to be best at everything: food quality, service and value plus cleanliness, hospitality, accuracy of order, maintenance and speed of service. We do this through market surveys and by measuring your feedback. Feel free to give us your thoughts on our service here.
				From time to time Pizza Hut issues discount coupons or added value coupons for use by Pizza Hut customers. Coupons may be available in a variety of formats e.g. printed coupon, gift coupon, emails or web offers. We’ll use the word ‘coupon’ to cover all these scenarios unless otherwise indicated.
				Coupons are usually for limited time offers and may differ by region, though not always.
				From time to time our stores may also offer different prices to those published on the website. If you order a pizza for pick up from the website and when you pick it up the price in store is lower than what you paid online or were quoted for the exact same order, we will gladly refund the difference. If you have not already paid we will also pass on the difference. This does not apply to pizzas that are delivered.
				To get a discount or added value advertised in a coupon you must give us the coupon – whether the order is pick up or delivery.
				Unless otherwise indicated, coupons are valid for one item or offer per order per day, and may not be available in conjunction with other offers, coupons or special deals.
				You can add a wide variety of extra toppings to your pizza for as little as $2 to $3 per item, depending on the item. However there is a maximum of 7-10 toppings depending on the pizza - otherwise your pizza just won't be cooked to perfection!
				You also get to select the type of base you’d like for your Pizza Hut pizzas at no extra charge - choose from Pan, Classic or Thin’n Crispy. However, a surcharge applies for Stuffed Crust, Gluten Free and XL base options unless otherwise stated.
				You can also remove any topping you don’t like.
				A minimum order value of $20.00 inclusive of the delivery fee is required for delivery. From time to time, an additional surcharge may apply in the event that we are able to deliver to your address, which sits outside of our normal delivery zone.
				Delivery is not available in all areas, or at all times of the day.
				Our valued delivery drivers do not carry any cash.
				If you are ordering more than 10 pizzas in one go – we need at least an hour’s notice so that we can put all the love and care into making you the best possible pizzas!</p>
